# Application â€“ ZippyJourney

## Main Problem
Planning a one-day trip to explore a new city can be overwhelming. Visitors often struggle with limited time, long distances between landmarks, and the challenge of organizing an efficient walking route that covers the most valuable spots without wasting time or energy.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
ZippyJourney will be an AI-powered travel assistant that simplifies trip planning by asking users a few key questions:

- "Which city are you visiting?"
- "Will you be traveling mainly by foot?"
- "How much time do you have available?"
- "Where will you start your journey?"
- "Do you need to return to your starting point?"

Based on the answers, the app will generate an optimized walking route that covers the most iconic monuments and attractions within the given timeframe.
The route will be visualized on an interactive map, with markers highlighting each stop.
Additionally, the app will provide an option to generate a shareable Google Maps link for easy navigation on the go.

## Future Enhancements
Once the optimal route is generated, ZippyJourney could offer personalized add-ons, including food or coffee break suggestions:

- "When would you like to take a break?"
- "Are you looking for coffee, lunch, or just a quick snack?"
- "Do you have any preferences? (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, specific cuisines)"

These stops will be intelligently integrated into the planned route, ensuring users have a smooth, enjoyable journey without unnecessary detours.
